                  Put the script in $HOME/bin and make a link to it in the desired folder.
                  Don't forget to chmod +x the file. Run script: python3 makePicIndex.py
                 
bulk_rename.py : python script that do 3 things :
                 1. It lowercase all the files.
                 2. It removes all the blank spaces in the filenames
                 3. It rename all files starting from img0001 to img99999

The code is very easy to follow and you can comment out the things you don't want. Again
put the file in $HOME/bin (or other folder) and chmod +x the file. Run it in the desired
folder: pyhton3 bulk_rename.py
